# MIMO-Decoder-for-4-by-4-MIMO-Systems-with-8-PSK-Modulation
Designed a MIMO decoder for 4x4 MIMO systems using a 4-best sphere decoding algorithm. Implemented in Verilog and MATLAB with a 15-bit fixed-point representation. Achieved the same BER as maximum likelihood (ML) decoding at 15.5 dB SNR, demonstrating reliable performance under noisy channel conditions.
